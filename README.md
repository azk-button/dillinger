# Dillinger

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Version
3.1.1

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Marked] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

## Running locally

Click the button bellow to quickly and safely install this project on your local machine.

[![Run project](https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.azk.io/run-project.png)](http://run.azk.io/start/?repo=run-project/dillinger)

The `Run Project` button employs `azk`, a lightweight open source orchestration tool that will automatically isolate and configure the application's environment for you.

Learn more about `azk` [here](https://github.com/azukiapp/azk).

## Deploying to DigitalOcean

After you run this project locally using [`Run Project` button](#running-locally), deploying to [DigitalOcean](http://digitalocean.com/) is very simple.

First, be sure you have SSH keys configured in your machine. If you don't have it yet (or if you aren't sure about it), just follow steps 1 and 2 of [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

Next, put your [personal access token](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications) into a `.env` file:

```bash
$ cd path/to/the/project
$ echo "DEPLOY_API_TOKEN=<YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN>" >> .env
```

Then, just run the following:

```bash
$ azk shell deploy
```

The `Run Project` button employs `azk`, a lightweight open source orchestration tool that will automatically isolate and configure the application's environment for you.

Find instructions for further resources (mostly customizations) to deploy to DigitalOcean using `azk` [here](http://docs.azk.io/en/deploy/README.html).
